IOSpec version 0.2
  Author: Wouter Swierstra <wss@cs.nott.ac.uk>

IOSpec provides a library containing pure, executable specifications
of a few functions from the IO monad. 

Build instructions:

    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs configure
    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs build
    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs install

See http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/Cabal/builders.html
for more instructions.

Documentation:

Please have a look at the latest documentation available from:
  http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~wss/repos/IOSpec

To build the Haddock API execute the following command:
    $ runhaskell Setup.lhs haddock

This will require Haddock 2.0

Check out the examples directory for the following examples:

    * Echo.hs - illustrates how to test the echo function.
    * Queues.hs - an implementation of queues using IORefs.
    * Channels.hs - an implementation of channels using MVars.
    * Sudoku.hs - a parallel Sudoku solver that uses STM and MVars
         based on Graham Hutton's version of Richard Bird's "Solving Sudoku".

Every example contains quite some comments, explaining how to use
the library.
